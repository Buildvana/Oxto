## What it is

Oxto is just a test project, used to experiment with GitHub Actions and Buildvana SDK. The project's goal is establishing a standard workflow for .NET development, to be later implemented in [Buildvana](https://github.com/Buildvana) projects, as well as in projects (both open-source and commercial) developed by [Tenacom](https://github.com/Tenacom).

Once Oxto becomes somewhat stable, it will very probably be replaced by a template repository, to ease the bootstrapping of new projects.

The name "Oxto" has no meaning that I know of. This makes it easy to find and replace it.

### What can I do with it?

You are free (and encouraged) to fork this repository to do your own experiments, if you so desire.

As for the project itself, it does nothing useful. Sort of a glorified "Hello world".
